# ðŸš€ Deployment Quick Reference

## For Content Updates (Most Common)

**You don't need to deploy for new content!** Content is stored in the database and immediately accessible.

### If you need latest scripts/tools:
```bash
./deploy-content-only.sh
```
**Time:** ~30 seconds | **GitHub push:** Not needed

---

## For Application Updates

### 1. Push to GitHub first
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy
```bash
./deploy-simple.sh
```
**Time:** ~2-3 minutes

---

## For System Setup (Rare)

```bash
./deploy-current.sh
```
**Time:** ~10-15 minutes | **Only for initial setup**
