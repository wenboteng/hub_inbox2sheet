# Cron Jobs Explanation for OTA Answer Hub

## What are Cron Jobs?

Cron jobs are automated tasks that run on a schedule on Linux servers. They're like "scheduled tasks" in Windows or "automated workflows" in other systems.

## How Cron Jobs Work in Our Setup

### 1. **No DigitalOcean Cron Service Needed**
- We use the **system cron** (built into Linux)
- No additional DigitalOcean services required
- Runs directly on your droplet server

### 2. **Cron Job Structure**
```bash
# Format: minute hour day month weekday command
0 * * * * cd /root/projects/hub_inbox2sheet && npm run scrape:main
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `0` = At minute 0 (top of the hour)
- `*` = Every hour
- `*` = Every day of the month
- `*` = Every month
- `*` = Every day of the week
- `cd /root/projects/hub_inbox2sheet && npm run scrape:main` = The command to run

systemctl status cron

# Check recent cron activity
grep CRON /var/log/syslog
```

### 2. **Check Job Output**

# View recent logs
tail -20 /var/log/ota-hub-main-crawler.log

# Follow logs in real-time
tail -f /var/log/ota-hub-main-crawler.log
```

### 3. **Test Jobs Manually**
```bash
# Test a specific job
cd /root/projects/hub_inbox2sheet
npm run scrape:main

# Test with logging
npm run scrape:main >> /var/log/ota-hub-main-crawler.log 2>&1
```

## Troubleshooting Cron Jobs

### Common Issues:

1. **Jobs not running:**
   ```bash
   # Check cron service
   systemctl status cron
   
   # Restart cron service
   systemctl restart cron
   ```

2. **Permission issues:**
   ```bash
   # Check file permissions
   ls -la /root/projects/hub_inbox2sheet
   
   # Fix permissions if needed
   chmod +x /root/projects/hub_inbox2sheet/package.json
   ```

3. **Environment variables not available:**
   ```bash
   # Cron jobs don't have access to .env by default
   # The setup-cron.sh script handles this by using full paths
   ```

4. **Disk space issues:**
   ```bash
   # Check disk space
   df -h
   
   # Clean up old logs
   find /var/log/ota-hub-*.log -mtime +7 -delete
   ```

## Advantages of System Cron vs DigitalOcean Cron

### System Cron (What We Use):
- ‚úÖ **Free** - No additional cost
- ‚úÖ **Full control** - Customize timing and commands
- ‚úÖ **Better logging** - Detailed logs for debugging
- ‚úÖ **Integration** - Runs in same environment as app
- ‚úÖ **Reliability** - Built into Linux, very stable

### DigitalOcean Cron Service:
- ‚ùå **Additional cost** - $5-10/month per job
- ‚ùå **Limited control** - Fixed scheduling options
- ‚ùå **Separate environment** - May have different dependencies
- ‚ùå **Less logging** - Limited debugging information

## Summary

Our cron jobs are:
1. **Automated** - Run without manual intervention
2. **Scheduled** - Run at specific times
3. **Logged** - All output is saved to log files
4. **Reliable** - Use system cron (very stable)
5. **Free** - No additional DigitalOcean services needed

The `setup-cron.sh` script automatically configures all these jobs for you, so you don't need to manually set up anything!
