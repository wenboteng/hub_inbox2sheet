## üé® Customization

### Adjusting Prompts

You can customize the GPT prompts in `src/utils/openai.ts`:

**Title/Intro Enhancement:**
```typescript
const prompt = `You are a content editor for a data-driven tour industry insights platform. 
Rewrite the following title and introduction to make them more emotionally engaging and 
curiosity-driven, without distorting the facts...`;
```

**Summary Box Generation:**
```typescript
const prompt = `Based on the following report section, generate a short, plain-language 
summary box titled "What This Means for You". Include a 1-sentence insight, and 1 
actionable step for a tour vendor...`;
```

**Share Suggestions:**
```typescript
const prompt = `Summarize this report in 1‚Äì2 short tweet-style insights that are punchy, 
data-backed, and engaging. Add a light emotional tone or FOMO if appropriate...`;
```

### Temperature Settings

- **Title/Intro**: `temperature: 0.8` (more creative)
- **Summary Boxes**: `temperature: 0.7` (balanced)
- **Share Suggestions**: `temperature: 0.8` (more engaging)

### Token Limits

- **Title/Intro**: `max_tokens: 300`
- **Summary Boxes**: `max_tokens: 150`
- **Share Suggestions**: `max_tokens: 200`

---

## üìä Performance & Costs

### API Call Optimization
- **Per Report**: ~3-5 API calls (title/intro + 2-3 summary boxes + share suggestions)
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple reports efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to original content

### Cost Estimation
- **GPT-4o**: ~$0.01-0.03 per report enrichment
- **Batch of 10 reports**: ~$0.10-0.30
- **Monthly (100 reports)**: ~$1-3

### Performance Tips
1. **Cache Results**: Store enriched content to avoid re-processing
2. **Batch Processing**: Enrich multiple reports in sequence
3. **Error Recovery**: Fall back to original content if enrichment fails
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respect OpenAI API rate limits

---

## üîÑ Automation

### Cron Job Integration

Add to your existing cron job on Render:

```bash
# Enrich reports weekly
0 2 * * 0 curl -X POST https://your-app.onrender.com/api/reports/enrich \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reportType": "vendor-analytics"}'
```

### Webhook Integration

Trigger enrichment when new reports are generated:

```typescript
// In your report generation scripts
if (newReportGenerated) {
  await fetch('/api/reports/enrich', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ reportType: newReport.type })
  });
}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. OpenAI API Errors**
```
Error: Failed to enrich report with GPT-4o
```
**Solution**: Check your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and API quota.

**2. Content Too Long**
```
Error: Token limit exceeded
```
**Solution**: The system automatically truncates content to fit token limits.

**3. No Enrichment Applied**
```
Warning: Enrichment failed, using original content
```
**Solution**: Check API connectivity and try again. Original content is preserved.

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```typescript
// Add to your environment variables
DEBUG_GPT_ENRICHMENT=true
```

### Manual Override

If enrichment fails, you can manually edit reports in the database:
```sql
UPDATE reports 
SET content = 'your enriched content here' 
WHERE type = 'your-report-type';
```
