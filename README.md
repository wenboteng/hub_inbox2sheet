### Scheduled Crawling (Cron Jobs) on Render

To keep your knowledge base fresh and growing, set up the following **Render Cron Jobs**:

|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `recheck`             | Every 6 hrs | `npm run recheck`              | Refreshes existing content only if it is old or changed |
| `discovery`           | Daily       | `npm run discovery`            | Discovers and crawls new official articles and threads  |
| `community-discover`  | Every 12 hrs| `npm run community-discover`   | Finds and crawls new community/forum content           |

**How to set up each job:**
- **Build Command:**
  ```bash
  npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build
  ```
- **Start Command:** (choose one per job)
  ```bash
  npm run recheck
  # or
  npm run discovery

forum categories. After editing these files, regenerate the compiled scripts:

```bash
npm run build:scripts
```
