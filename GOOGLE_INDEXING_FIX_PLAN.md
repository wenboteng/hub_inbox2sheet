# 🚨 GOOGLE INDEXING FIX PLAN - AIRBNB RANKING REPORT

## 📊 Current Problem
Your report page at `https://otaanswers.com/reports/airbnb-ranking-algorithm-complete-guide-for-hosts-2025` is showing a **"Soft 404"** error in Google Search Console, which means Google thinks the page doesn't exist even though it does.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **missing API routes** that the frontend JavaScript was trying to fetch from:
- ❌ `/api/reports/[slug]/route.ts` - Missing
- ❌ `/api/reports/[slug]/pdf/route.ts` - Missing

This caused the page to show "Loading..." indefinitely, making Google think the page was broken.

## ✅ Fixes Already Applied
1. **Created missing API route** for individual reports
2. **Created missing PDF generation route** 
3. **Verified sitemap** includes report URLs
